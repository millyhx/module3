CROSS- SITE SCRIPTING (XSS)

Cross-site scripting attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious
scripts are injected into trusted websites.

XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious
code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user.

The end user's browser has no way to know that the script should not be trusted,
and will execute the script. 

Because it thinks that the script came from a trusted source, the malicious 
script can access any cookies, session tokens or other sensitive information
retained by the browser and use within that site.


COMPONENTS WITH KNOWN VULNERABILITIES

Some vulnerable components include frameowork libraries. These components can be 
identified and exploited with automated tools. An attacker will identify a weak
component through scanning or manual analysis.

Then the attacker will customize the exploit as needed and execute the attack.
It will get more difficuilt to carry out the attack if the component is deep in 
the application.

Most applications have these issues because most development teams might not focus
on ensuring their components/libraries are up to date. 

The full range of weaknesses is possible, including injection, broken access control,
XSS etc.
